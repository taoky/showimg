# showimg

A very simple GTK program to show a picture without window decoration in Linux (supports transparent PNG files). Written in gtk-rs.

Hint: Right click or press Alt + Space to activate mutter window menu in GNOME. You can set the window to be "Always on Top" there.

## Build

### Pre-build binaries & flatpak

You can download pre-build binaries or flatpak bundle from GitHub Releases.

The binary is compiled under Ubuntu 22.04, which shall work for all FHS-compliant distros after that, as long as you have installed GTK 4.4 or later.

If you prefer flatpak, just install with:

```shell
flatpak install --user ./moe.taoky.showimg.flatpak
```

### Cargo

```shell
cargo build --release
```

### Flatpak

```shell
flatpak-builder --install repo build-aux/moe.taoky.showimg.yaml --force-clean --user
```
