A very simple GTK program to show a picture without window decoration in Linux (supports transparent PNG files). Written in gtk-rs.

Hint: Press Alt + Space to activate mutter window menu in GNOME. You can set the window to be "Always on Top" there.

## Usage

```
./showimg --file ./path/to/img
```

Picture will be shown with their natural size.
